Question 1
Which of the following constituted advantages to AT&T's elimination of in-band signaling from the phone network in the 1980s?

(i) Improved security
(ii) Easier configuration and management
(iii) Reduction of expenditures
(iv) Introduction of new services
```
```
Question 2
What types of functions were enabled by active networks?

(i) Packets carrying code in the payload could be executed on intermediate nodes in the network (e.g., routers, switches)
Code installed on nodes in the network (e.g., at routers and switches) could process packets.
(ii) A single node in the network could perform more than one function on a packet or stream of packets (e.g., firewalling, followed by load balance).
(iii) Code running on end hosts (e.g., machines sending and receiving packets) could modify packet contents.
)iv) All routers in the network needed to support active networks for active networks to be deployable.
```
```
Question 3
Which of the following is true about network virtualization?
Virtual networks can be realized by dividing switch forwarding tables based on fields in the packet header 
(e.g., IP address and port).

(i) Network virtualization requires the instantiation of virtual machines at each intermediate node (e.g., switch, router) in the network.
(ii) Network virtualization requires every router and switch in the network to run custom technology supporting virtualization.
(iii) Network virtualization was invented in the late 2000s to support the migration of virtual machines in data centers.
(iv) Network virtualization allows multiple service providers to share the same underlying physical infrastructure.
```
```
Question 4
Which of the following are true about various systems developed for central control of packet-switched networks?

(i) The Routing Control Platform requires changes to existing routers to support central control.
(ii) The RCP could be deployed within a single ISP network, without coordination across multiple ISPs.
(iii) The OpenFlow protocol requires vendors to expose the details of how they implement flow table maintenance in their switches.
(iv) Ethane's initial goal was to support authentication of hosts in enterprise networks.
(v) The FORCES protocol is deployed on most major routers and switches today.
```
```
Question 5
Which three artifacts and lessons that active networks affected the development of software-defined networks? 
Select all that apply.

(i) centralized control
(ii) packet headers
(iii) distributed state management
(iv) programmable functions
(v) demultiplexing
