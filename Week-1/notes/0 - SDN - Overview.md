Software Defined Networking (SDN) -- Introduction

-- Separates data plane and control plane.
-- Controls network behavior from single high-level control program.
-- Deployments to solve network management problems in real networks.
-- Two parts to the infrastructure:
(i) Data plane => Programmable switches
(ii) Control plane => Controllers, Apps
```

BAMM!

SDN architecture is composed of bundling of routers based upon,
-- Specialized features
-- Specialized control plane
-- Specialized hardware

<<<>>> Vertically integrated closed, proprietary slow innovation.7

Apps openly interface with Control plane that followed by openly interfacing Merchant Switching chips.
In a better way,
Horizontal, open interface, rapid innovation.

Advantages of SDN over Conventional Networking architectures:

-- Easier to coordinate behavior among a network of devices.
-- Easier to evolve.
-- Easier to reason.
-- Easier to apply conventional computer science approaches to old problems.
```

SDN infrastructure: Two parts

(i) Software "Control Plane"
-- The network's brain
-- It can be run separately from devices
-- It computes logic of how traffic will be forwarded

(ii) Programmable "Data Plane"
-- Typically programmable hardware
-- Controlled by the control plane
```
```
SDN - Applications:

-- Data centers
-- Wide-area backbone network
-- Enterprise networks
-- Internet exchange points
-- Home networks
```
